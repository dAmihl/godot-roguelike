# Basic Godot Roguelike Template

Very basic and simple roguelike template in Godot Engine.


**Getting started is the hardest part.**
**Maybe it helps someone to get started on something good :)**

* Movement on a Tilemap
* Enemies spawning based on tiles
* Basic simultanous combat (by moving into an enemy)
* Very Basic UI showing the stats as well as a simple combat log
